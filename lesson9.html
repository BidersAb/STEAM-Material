        <h2>Introduction to Virtual Reality (VR)</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the world of Virtual Reality! VR is a groundbreaking technology that changes how we interact with digital content, moving beyond flat screens to create immersive, three-dimensional worlds.</p>

        <h3>What is Virtual Reality?</h3>
        <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment. In simple terms, VR tricks your senses into believing you are in a different place, completely immersing you in a digital world.</p>

        <h3>How Does VR Work? The Key Components</h3>
        <p>A typical VR system has three main components that work together to create the immersive experience:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>The VR Headset:</strong> This is the most important piece of equipment. It’s a headset you wear over your eyes, containing two small high-resolution screens—one for each eye. Each screen displays a slightly different image, mimicking how our eyes see in the real world, creating a sense of depth and three-dimensionality (stereoscopic 3D). The headset also contains motion sensors that track your head movements so your view changes accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Controllers:</strong> VR systems come with handheld controllers that track the position and movement of your hands. This allows you to "reach out" and interact with objects in the virtual world—you can pick things up, press buttons, or even use tools like a virtual paintbrush or sword.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A Powerful Computer or Console:</strong> The headset is connected to (or communicates with) a powerful computer, gaming console, or sometimes a high-end smartphone. This device runs the VR software and generates the complex graphics needed to create a believable virtual world in real-time.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

        <h2>VR vs. AR: What’s the Difference?</h2>
        <p>You may have also heard of Augmented Reality (AR). While related, VR and AR are very different:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Virtual Reality (VR)</strong> replaces your world. It completely blocks out your real-world surroundings and immerses you in a new, digital environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Augmented Reality (AR)</strong> adds to your world. It overlays digital information—like images, text, or animations—onto your view of the real world, often through a smartphone camera or special glasses. A popular example is the mobile game Pokémon Go.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Applications of VR: More Than Just Games</h2>
        <p>While gaming is the most popular use of VR today, its applications in professional fields are growing rapidly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Medical Training:</strong> Surgeons can practice complex operations in a risk-free virtual environment before performing them on a real patient.</li>
          <li><strong>Engineering and Design:</strong> Aerospace engineers at companies like Boeing can build and test virtual prototypes of airplanes, identifying design flaws and testing ergonomics before building expensive physical models.</li>
          <li><strong>Education and Training:</strong> Students can take virtual field trips to ancient Rome, or technicians can learn how to repair complex machinery by practicing on a virtual model.</li>
          <li><strong>Therapy and Healthcare:</strong> VR is used to help patients overcome phobias (like fear of heights) by exposing them to their fears in a safe, controlled virtual setting.</li>
        </ul>
