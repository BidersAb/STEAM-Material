      <section>
        <h2>Cabin Redesign</h2>
        <p>Welcome to your final lesson, where you will step into the shoes of an aircraft design engineer! This lesson challenges you to rethink the interior of a modern airliner to solve complex problems, combining creativity, engineering, and an understanding of passenger needs.</p>

        <h3>Health and Safety in the Air</h3>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic made people more aware than ever of health and safety during air travel. Aircraft manufacturers like Boeing are constantly researching new ways to make flying safer.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>What features already reduce disease transmission?</strong>
            <p>Most modern aircraft are equipped with High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, similar to those used in hospital rooms. These filters can trap over 99.99% of small particles, including bacteria and viruses. The air in the cabin is a 50/50 mixture of fresh air from the outside and this recirculated, filtered air, and it is completely refreshed as often as every two to three seconds.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What new technologies are being investigated?</strong>
            <p>Boeing is researching new materials that could kill viruses that land on them, such as antimicrobial coatings for high-touch surfaces like lavatories. They are also developing a portable ultraviolet (UV) disinfector that staff could use to kill viruses on surfaces within seconds.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Make Connections</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>To You:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed global travel habits. For airline travel to continue to grow, additional safeguards and systems may need to be put in place to ensure passenger confidence and safety.</li>
          <li><strong>To Careers:</strong> This field involves many important careers:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Aircraft Design Engineer:</strong> Designs, constructs, and tests aircraft, including the interior cabins, to meet quality and safety standards.</li>
              <li><strong>Epidemiologist:</strong> A "disease detective" who studies disease outbreaks to understand how they are transmitted and how to stop them.</li>
              <li><strong>Exposure Scientist:</strong> Studies how people come into contact with environmental factors and their effects on the human body.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Exercises: Single-Seat Innovation -->
      <section>
        <h2>Cabin Redesign Exercises: Single-Seat Innovation</h2>
        <p><strong>Beginner Exercise:</strong> Before redesigning the whole cabin, focus on a single component: the economy class seat.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Identify the Problems: As a group, brainstorm at least three problems with a typical economy airplane seat related to health, comfort, or privacy. (e.g., "The tray table is hard to clean," "There is no storage for personal items like a phone," "The armrests have to be shared.")</li>
          <li>Sketch a New Design: On a piece of paper, sketch a new and improved economy seat that solves the problems you identified.</li>
          <li>Label Your Innovations: Label at least three new features on your sketch and write a short sentence explaining the benefit of each one. (e.g., "Antimicrobial tray table surface," "Built-in phone holder and charger," "Staggered armrest design so passengers aren't touching elbows.")</li>
          <li>Present Your Seat: Share your innovative seat design with another group and explain how it improves the passenger experience.</li>
        </ol>

      <!-- Rocket Inspired by SLS -->
      <section>
        <h2>Rocket Inspired by SLS</h2>
        <p>By the end of this course, participants will be able to construct a paper rocket with a ping pong ball payload, design and assemble a simple launch setup using PVC pipes and a plastic bottle, and test and adjust the launch angle to hit a target.</p>

        <h3>Materials Needed:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Paper (for the rocket body)</li>
          <li>PVC pipe (sized appropriately for the rocket body)</li>
          <li>A joint for connecting PVC pipes</li>
          <li>A plastic bottle (for air pressure generation)</li>
          <li>A ping pong ball (as the rocket payload)</li>
          <li>Scissors</li>
          <li>Tape or glue</li>
          <li>A target for aiming practice</li>
          <li>Optional: Markers or stickers for decorating the rocket</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FsqPipN5HI">Video instructions</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructional Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Building the Rocket:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Construct the Rocket Body: Roll a piece of paper around the PVC pipe to form the rocket body, ensuring the fit is snug but not too tight.</li>
              <li>Add the Payload: Attach a ping pong ball to one end of the rocket body.</li>
              <li>Create Fins: Cut out 3-4 fins from another piece of paper and attach them evenly around the base of the rocket to stabilize it during flight.</li>
              <li>Make the Pointy Top: Cut out a cone shape from paper and attach it to the top of the rocket to reduce air resistance.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Building the Testing Setup:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Assemble the Launch Setup: Attach two PVC pipes together using the joint, ensuring it can pivot to adjust the launch angle. Secure the plastic bottle to one end of the PVC pipe to act as your air pressure chamber.</li>
              <li>Secure the Setup: Ensure the launch setup is stable and will not tip over during launch.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Testing the Rocket:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Prepare for Launch: Place your rocket onto the open end of the PVC pipe.</li>
              <li>Adjust and Launch: Pivot the joint to set your launch angle, aim at your target, and squeeze the plastic bottle quickly to generate a burst of air that propels the rocket.</li>
              <li>Evaluate and Adjust: Observe the rocket's flight and make adjustments to the design or launch angle as needed to improve accuracy.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Safety Considerations:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure the launch area is clear of obstacles and people.</li>
          <li>Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes.</li>
          <li>Handle scissors and other sharp objects with care.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Self-Deploying Satellite -->
      <section>
        <h2>Self-Deploying Satellite</h2>

        <h3>Materials Needed:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tape</li>
          <li>Scissors</li>
          <li>A small container or small boxes</li>
          <li>Long rubber bands</li>
          <li>Cardboard</li>
          <li>Dowels or skewers</li>
          <li>A hole puncher</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnPSmU4q4QA">Video instructions</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Building Your Device:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Find an empty small box to use as the body of your device.</li>
          <li>Punch four holes into the container, ensuring they line up directly across from each other and are big enough for a dowel and rubber band.</li>
          <li>Make your solar wings by taping rectangular pieces of cardboard onto dowels. Ensure all wings are the same size.</li>
          <li>Insert the wings into the holes in your container, making sure they can bend up and down.</li>
          <li>Cut a rubber band so it is a single strip. Attach one end to the top of a solar wing, thread it through the container holes, and attach it to the wing on the opposite side.</li>
          <li>Fold the wings up vertically to stretch the rubber band. When you let go, it should snap back to its resting position.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Testing Your Device:</h3>
        <p>Once ready, fold all the solar wings up into a compact position and toss your device in the air. If connected properly, it should deploy all of its solar wings.</p>
