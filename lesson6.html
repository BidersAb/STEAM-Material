        <h2>Drone Wing Design</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to a lesson where engineering meets biology! Today, we will explore the fascinating world of drones and learn how engineers often look to the natural world for inspiration to create amazing new technologies.
        </p>
        <h3>What exactly is a Drone?</h3>
        <p>
          A drone, also known as an &quot;unmanned aerial vehicle&quot; (UAV), is an aircraft that does not have a pilot on board. While some drones require continuous commands from a human, the most advanced ones can operate using a wide range of technologies, including artificial intelligence and computer vision, to fly pre-programmed flight paths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally developed for military use, drones are now used for a huge range of commercial purposes, from monitoring traffic and surveying remote areas to fertilizing crops and delivering medical supplies.

        <h2>What is Biomimicry?</h2>
        <p>
          Biomimicry is the practice of imitating designs and processes found in nature to solve human problems. The idea is that because organisms have been evolving for billions of years, many have already developed incredibly efficient solutions for living on Earth. By studying how birds fly, how fish swim, or how dolphins send signals, humans can learn from nature's genius to create better, stronger, and more sustainable designs.

        <h3>Make Connections</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>To You:</strong> The impact of drones on our daily lives is growing rapidly. They are already used for everything from delivering packages to capturing high-definition imagery for real estate agents.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To Careers:</strong> This field involves many exciting careers:
            <ul>
              <li>Aerospace Engineer: Designs aircraft, spacecraft, drones, and satellites.</li>
              <li>Software Engineer: Develops the software and operating systems that control drones.</li>
              <li>Biomimicry Specialist: Helps companies incorporate nature-inspired design into their problem-solving.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To Our World:</strong> Drones are making a significant global impact. For example, companies like Zipline use drones to deliver vital medical supplies to remote populations around the world. During the COVID-19 pandemic, drones were used for sanitation, public service announcements, and aerial surveillance.

        <h2>Wing Design Research: Learning from Nature</h2>
        <p>
          See what you can learn about wing design from nature by researching the living creatures below. As you conduct your research, record notes about each living thing's wing design, flight patterns, and how their bodies have adapted to fly successfully. Then, consider what information might be helpful as you begin to design new drone wings, and record this in the third column.
        </p>

        <h2>Drone Exercises: Biomimicry Sketch Challenge</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Choose Two Creatures: Select two different flying creatures (e.g., a bat, a butterfly, an eagle).</li>
          <li>Research Their Wings: Spend 10 minutes researching what makes their wings unique. How are they shaped? Are they rigid or flexible? What are they made of?</li>
          <li>Create a Hybrid Sketch: On a piece of paper, sketch a new drone wing design that combines features from both of the creatures you researched.</li>
          <li>Label Your Design: Label at least three features on your sketch and write a short sentence explaining which creature inspired it and why you included it (e.g., "Serrated edge like an eagle's wing for better stability," "Flexible joints like a bat's wing for maneuverability").</li>
          <li>Share with a Partner: Explain your hybrid design to a partner.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Main Challenge: Build a Drone Wing</h2>
        <p><strong>Your Challenge:</strong> Build a lightweight wing structure that is at least 12 inches long. It must be able to hold a heavy load without deflecting too much or breaking. Be creative and use your biomimicry research!</p>

        <h3>You Will Need:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Different types of paper</li>
          <li>Scissors</li>
          <li>Tape</li>
          <li>Straws</li>
          <li>One paper cup</li>
          <li>String</li>
          <li>Marbles or other weights</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Brainstorm and Design: Consider how the available materials could be used to build a strong and flexible wing. You may find it helpful to sketch your design ideas first.
            <p><em>Tip:</em> Consider layering materials or arranging them in triangular patterns for strength.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Construct: Bring your ideas to life! Build a strong, flexible, and lightweight wing that is at least 12 inches long.</li>
          <li>Test and Optimize:
            <ul>
              <li>Create a hanger for the weights by punching two holes in the paper cup and looping string through them.</li>
              <li>Have a team member hold one end of your wing. Place the string hanger over the other end of the wing (about two inches from the end) so the cup hangs below.</li>
              <li>Test the strength and flexibility of your wing by carefully loading marbles (or another weight) into the cup, one by one.</li>
              <li>Observe what happens as you add more weight. Your goal is to have your wing hold as much weight as possible without breaking!</li>
              <li>Feel free to stop, analyze any weak points, and make changes to improve your design.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
