        <h2>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
        <p>Welcome to one of the most transformative fields in all of technology: Artificial Intelligence. AI is no longer a concept from science fiction; it is a powerful force actively shaping our world. This lesson will guide you through the fundamental types of AI, the technologies that power it, and cutting-edge models like ChatGPT that you can interact with today.</p>

        <h3>The Evolution of AI</h3>
        <p>The history of Artificial Intelligence began with a wave of excitement in the 1950s. The field's development can be traced through several key milestones, including powerful subsets like Machine Learning and Deep Learning that have created significant disruptions over time:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1950s:</strong> AI pioneer Arthur Samuel developed one of the first self-learning systems—a program that played checkers and improved its performance by learning from past games. In 1959, Samuel coined the term "Machine Learning."</li>
          <li><strong>1960s:</strong> Development of early neural networks and the perceptron model.</li>
          <li><strong>1980s:</strong> Machine learning flourished with advanced neural networks and the backpropagation algorithm.</li>
          <li><strong>2000s:</strong> The rise of big data and increased computational power fueled further progress.</li>
          <li><strong>2010s:</strong> The "deep learning revolution" led to breakthroughs in image and speech recognition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>At its core, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science dedicated to creating machines or systems that perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. These include learning from experience, solving complex problems, understanding human language, recognizing images, and making decisions.</p>
        <p>AI can be categorized by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Capability:</strong> What AI can do.</li>
          <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> How AI "thinks."</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Significance of AI in Modern Technology</h3>
        <p>AI is revolutionizing various industries and aspects of daily life:</p>
        <ul>

          <li><strong>Healthcare Advancements:</strong> Assists in diagnosing diseases, predicting outcomes, and personalizing treatments by analyzing medical images and data.</li>
          <li><strong>Enhanced User Experiences:</strong> Provides personalized recommendations on platforms like Netflix and Amazon.</li>
          <li><strong>Smart Assistants:</strong> Virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant understand voice commands to simplify daily life.</li>
          <li><strong>Transportation and Safety:</strong> AI powers self-driving cars that analyze traffic and make real-time driving decisions to reduce accidents.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Analysis and Decision Making:</strong> Businesses leverage AI to analyze vast data sets, uncover trends, and optimize operations.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Types of AI by Capability (The Three Stages)</h3>
        <p>This common classification is based on AI’s intelligence level relative to humans:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) or "Weak AI":</strong> The only type currently existing. Designed to perform one specific task. Examples include Siri, Alexa, self-driving cars, and spam filters.</li>
          <li><strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or "Strong AI":</strong> A future AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge indistinguishably from humans. It does not yet exist.</li>
          <li><strong>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):</strong> A theoretical stage where AI surpasses human intelligence in all fields.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Types of AI by Functionality (The Four Kinds)</h3>
        <p>This focuses on how AI processes information and its level of "consciousness":</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Reactive Machines:</strong> Basic AI that reacts only to current situations without memory. Example: IBM’s Deep Blue chess program.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited Memory:</strong> AI that uses past data to inform current decisions. Most Narrow AI today, such as self-driving cars and Netflix’s recommendation engine.</li>
          <li><strong>Theory of Mind:</strong> Future AI that can understand emotions, beliefs, and thoughts. Does not yet exist.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-Awareness:</strong> Ultimate theoretical AI stage with consciousness and self-understanding.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning</h3>
        <p><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> AI method where models learn from large data sets to recognize patterns and make predictions without explicit programming.</p>
        <p><strong>Deep Learning (DL):</strong> Subfield of ML using deep neural networks with many layers, powering today’s advanced AI, including Generative AI.</p>
